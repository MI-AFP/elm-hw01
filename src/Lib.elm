valid triangles.

the first number of the list mulitplied by 2.
If the list is Nothing or empty, it should return 0.

Do not use pattern matching or conditions, use helper functions from Maybe
package and |> operator to chain them together.

style and >> or << operators to chain needed functions together.

{-| Write a function that takes a string that contains property names and
float values e.g.:

""""
a = 12.5
b = 5.4

tx = 18
"""

It converts the string into a dict with string keys and float values. Empty
lines and whitespaces should be skipped. The return value should be wrapped in
result and it should return an error if it cannot be parsed.

{-| This function should return an index of the given element in the list. If
the element does not exist, it should return Nothing.

Do not implement this function by yourself. Find an Elm package that
already has the function and use it here.
